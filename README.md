Automatic Expense Tracking by Receipt Scanning
The PayFair application aims to solve the common calculation confusion that arises when individuals pay their bills separately in places like cafes or restaurants. The fundamental purpose of the project is to facilitate users in calculating the prices of the items they have consumed, determining the total cost of the services received, and conveniently storing their expenses for future review. 

- The application has been developed using a cross-platform development structure.
- The application is coded using the Flutter platform, which utilizes the Dart programming language.
- The scanning process in our application is performed using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology.
- Tesseract is used among the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) libraries.
- The application maintains a data log using the Firebase database, a service provided by Google.
